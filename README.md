# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to **predict the Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning models trained on environmental data such as concentrations of various air pollutants. The goal is to build a predictive system that can help assess air quality levels and support initiatives for public health and environmental awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze real-world air pollution datasets
* Predict AQI values based on features like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃
* Evaluate model performance and interpret results
* Visualize AQI trends and model predictions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding environment

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset typically includes:

* **PM2.5, PM10** – Particulate Matter concentrations
* **NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃** – Gaseous pollutants
* **Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed** *(optional)*
* **AQI or AQI Category** – Target variable

---

## 🔍 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Feature scaling/normalization

2. **Model Training**

   * Linear Regression
   * Random Forest
   * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   * XGBoost or other advanced models (optional)

3. **Model Evaluation**

   * RMSE, MAE, R² Score
   * Cross-validation

4. **Prediction and Export**

   * Predict AQI from test data
   * Export results as CSV

---

## 📈 Visualizations

* Pollution concentration trends over time
* AQI distribution histogram
* Predicted vs Actual AQI scatter plots
* Feature importance (for tree-based models)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aqi-prediction-ml.git
   cd aqi-prediction-ml
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
